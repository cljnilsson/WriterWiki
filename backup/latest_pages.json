At this point Zayne traveled to the capital and handpicked some boys from the many overflowing orphanages. Though few at first, as the building in the wilderness grew more and more were brought.\n\nThe orphans were taught hand to hand combat along with bow, spear or sword depending on talent and preference. United by hatred for the empire and gratitude towards the Nyr family they went on raids together once manhood was reached. Their targets were almost always rich merchants who were either too arrogant to feel safe within the empire's borders, or too cheap to buy competent protection.\n\nSecond Iteration\nAlmost two hundred years later, Iona Nyx were put into the position of head of the family after her parents both died by sickness.\nShe leaned on the ancient Zayne for advise at first and continued the traditions built in the orphanage. Yet she had ambitions, ones she did not believe could be fulfilled the way they were currently operating.\nAs she was supposed to choose a husband to continue the family line she took the chance to kill two birds with one stone. She knew what qualities she was looking for, she needed someone of decent status and influence. She was ready to have lower standards in other areas to be realistic, but she found herself lucky as she was bewitched be an influential merchant with a position at the trade union's board.\nAlthough neither family or orphans approved of her choice at the time, but once Iona pitched her vision she received Zayne's blessing.\n\nThe family had avoided detection by keeping their raids too infrequent for the empire to consider it worthwhile to send out men to investigate and properly deal with the situation. It was simply cheaper to accept the occasional loss. But as a result, they were barely an annoyance to the empire, if not less.\n\nIona sought a way to branch out.\nThe Orphanage begun to accept girls, which had previously not been done as boys were more fit for raids.\nFor most, the weapon practice were switched out for literature, history and math.  \nIona then made use of her husband's many connections to get the orphans apprenticeships in whatever field they desired among the middle and lower class options.\n\nBy the time Iona's own children became old enough to go to the Imperial Academy she had successfully spread out her orphans across the empire by many stations. Not only receiving information in the form of letters but also simply having the option to visit a trained shoemaker at a whim for new shoes or a tailor for a hat. An adventure which previously had been difficult as buying shoes in bulk was certainly something that raised eyebrows.\n\n","version":"1","wiki":"5f5b138df3945034b8223f70","__v":0},{"_id":"5cc9f4d63ee2972158af885b","title":"Gawain","html":"<p>Sir Gawain, Knight of the round table</p><p><br></p><p>Brother to Mordred and son of Morgan Le Fay.</p><h1><br></h1><h1>Hello</h1>","delta":"{\"ops\":[{\"insert\":\"Sir Gawain, Knight of the round table\\n\\nBrother to Mordred and son of Morgan Le Fay.\\n\"},{\"attributes\":{\"header\":1},\"insert\":\"\\n\"},{\"insert\":\"Hello\"},{\"attributes\":{\"header\":1},\"insert\":\"\\n\"}]}","raw":"Sir Gawain, Knight of the round table\n\nBrother to Mordred and son of Morgan Le Fay.\n\nHello\n","version":"1","__v":0,"wiki":"5f5a766bd667c536fc009b35"},{"_id":"5cca568d3ee2972158af8862","title":"Albion","html":"<p>A large island, over twice the size of The Highlands to the west.</p><p><br></p><p>Ruled by king Uther Blackmoore.</p><p><br></p><p>The kingdom does not allow magic, practicing it is punishable by death.
